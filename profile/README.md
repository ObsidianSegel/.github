# Obsidian Segel

This organization includes the following repositories:

- The `obsidian-segel-vault` - a vault with all the plugins, their configurations, scripts and mdm file classes.
- The `obsidian-segel-plugin` repo, a submodule of the vault that has all of the code that is unique to the Obsidian Segel system.
- The `metadatamenu-fork` repo - also a submodule of the vault, a fork of mdelobelle's metadata menu plugin, which has some unique features that we use, mainly - multiline input fields.
- The `xmind2linked` vault - A small script that generates a skill folder structure based on a tree given as an `xmind` diagram.
